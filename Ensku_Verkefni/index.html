        <h1>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</h1>
        <p>Arthur dent, a lonely British man finds himself in a precarious situation after his alien friend, Ford warns him of the imminent destruction of the Earth. Ford Prefect, being a researcher for the wholly remarkable book “<span class="hhg">Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</span>” has his ways of getting around and hitches a ride on the Vogon constructor fleet responsible for the vaporization of Earth. This leads them on a journey through the cosmos meeting friends, enemies, mice, shades of blue and a variety of other semi-intelligent species.
        <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hitchhikers-Guide-Galaxy/dp/B0009JKV9W/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2ZM1KTXU79TPB&dchild=1&keywords=the+hitchhiker%27s+guide+to+the+galaxy&qid=1618763313&sprefix=the+hitchh%2Caps%2C368&sr=8-1">Join Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect on a hitchhiking adventure through the galaxy.</a>
        </p>

        <h2>The Crew</h2>
        <h3>Arthur Dent</h3>
        <p>A man struggling with a lifestyle crisis isn’t exactly the optimal companion on a voyage across the galaxy, but Arthur Dent tries his best. As a tea-loving earthman Arthur struggles with finding his place in the world after the destruction of his homeworld, but finds comfort in sticking with his friend Ford Prefect, and the crew of the spaceship Heart of Gold as they hurl themselves across time and space, consistently on the verge of death.</p>
        
        <h3>Ford Prefect</h3>
        <p>Have you ever felt like you are stuck in a place you don’t much care for? Well then you know how Ford felt when he got stranded on the dreadful little orb known as the Earth for 15 years. Hailing from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse, Ford has spent much of his life as a researcher for the wholly remarkable book “<span class="hhg">Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</span>”, cataloguing everything he sees in his travels for further entries into the galactic encyclopedia.</p>
        
        <h3>Zaphod Beeblebrox</h3>
        <p>Also known as ‘Big-Z’, Ford’s semi-cousin, and president of the galaxy. The two-headed, three-armed trouble maker with brain injury spends his time gallivanting around pretending to understand just what the hell is going on. Being the president of the galaxy he enjoys quite a lot of fame, despite being a total crook. He stole the spaceship Heart of Gold at its unveiling ceremony after riding in on a hover boat, intending to use it to track down a mysterious ‘lost planet’.</p>
        
        <h3>Trillian</h3>
        <p>A human astrophysicist who Arthur once totally failed to ‘chat up’ at a party in Islington, she went off with Zaphod Beeblebrox to live out her life in space six months before the destruction of The Earth. She is the brains of the bunch, knowing quite a bit more than most about how a starship functions than the rest owing to her extensive education and interest in space.</p>
        
        <h2>The World</h2>
        <h3>Vogons</h3>
        <p>Employed as the galactic governments bureaucrats, the Vogons are known for their universally bad poetry, a highly domed nose that rises far above their “piggy” forehead, and of course their sex appeal, which is about the same as a road accident. They serve as antagonists in the story, being responsible for the destruction of the Earth to make space for a new bypass, which is unfortunate seeing as minutes after the vaporization of the Earth hyperspace bypasses became an outdated form of space-travel.</p>
        
        <h3>Magrathea</h3>
        <p>An ancient planet in orbit around the twin suns Soulianis and Rahm, the Magratheans were infact builders of custom-made, luxury planets for the wealthy and rich around five million years ago. After a resounding success Magrathea became the richest planet of all time, reducing the rest of the galaxy to abject poverty. This in turn prompted the Magratheans to go into hibernation to await a time when someone was rich enough to afford their services again. And after five million years, the very existence of the planet was debated, being one of the galaxies most popular myths.</p>
        
        <h3>The Heart of Gold</h3>
        <p>The spaceship that Arthur Dent and crew use to get around. It was stolen by Zaphod Beeblobrox at its unveiling ceremony. Being a one-of-a-kind due to its advanced method of space travel. It uses an infinite improbability drive to essentially appear anywhere in the universe in a mere nothingness of a second. When the infinite improbability drive reaches infinite improbability, it actually passes through each conceivable point in every conceivable universe simultaneously. A wide range of improbable events can be caused by this, for example a nuclear missile suddenly turning into a sperm whale.</p>

        <h1>Douglas Noel Adams</h1>
        <p>The English author, comic radio dramatist, and musician created <span class="hhg">Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</span> as a radio series. They were later adapted for TV in 1981	 and the Novels, which have gained international success. The idea for the title of the series first popped into his head when he was lying drunk in a field in Innsbruck, Austria, in 1971. He had been travelling with a copy of the Hich Hiker’s Guide to Europe by Ken Walsh. When the stars came out on that fateful night it occurred to him that someone should write a Hitchhiker’s guide to the galaxy. Being drunk, he quickly fell asleep and forgot all about it. Much later, after going to Cambridge University and becoming a writer, he had a pet project idea of combining comedy and science-fiction. This idea became an obsession of his and drove him into “debt and despair” (his words). After failing to sell the idea to anyone, a BBC radio producer named Simon Brett contacted him about the idea. Simon had had the same idea of comedy and sci-fi and helped produce the first two episodes of the project. Originally called “The ends of the Earth”. This was later changed when Adams was reminiscing about his time hitch hiking throughout Europe. At that point the title popped into his head from wherever it was hiding, and thus <span class="hhg">Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</span> was born. The rest is history.

            After the resounding success of the guide, he spent much of his later life as a sought after lecturer on technology and the environment. He was an environmental activist campaigning on behalf of endangered species, being part of many projects and charities concerning the subject. In 1994 he climbed Mount Kilimanjaro wearing a rhino suit for the British charity organisation ‘Save the Rhino International’.
            Tragically, Adams suffered a heart-attack from an undiagnosed coronary artery disease in 2001 when resting after his usual workout in a private gym in California.
